This is, perhaps, the year to learn to be big.  
Spruce tree big. Cliffside big. Big as mesa,  
as mountain lake. Big as in cosmos, as in love.  
Being small has never served meâ€” constricting,  
contorting, trying to fit into a room, into shoes,  
into a name. Let this be the year to escape all those little  
rules with those little shoulds, all those little. 
cages with their little locks. Time to make of myself. 
a key, time to lean into immensity. Time to supersize. 
communion, time to grow beyond self. Time to. 
open, to unwall, to do as the universe does,  
accelerating as it expands, not rushing toward. 
something else, but changing the scale of space itself.
